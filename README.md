## Configuration

**Important:** Before running the bot, make sure to set your bot `token` in `config/config.json`. You can get the token from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).

If youâ€™d like to use a custom `api_id` and `api_hash`, you can modify the respective fields in `config/config.json`. Obtain your `api_id` and `api_hash` [here](https://my.telegram.org).

For those who want to use a self-hosted API, consider using the [TDLib](https://github.com/tdlib/td) library, and adjust the configuration in `config/config.json` accordingly.

## Library

This bot is built with the [grammY](https://grammy.dev/) library and uses `yarn` for package management.
